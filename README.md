<p>This is a clone of YouTube's homepage where you can create an account or log in and upload a video, then the video can be watched.</p>
<h2 align='left'>How to set up project</h2>
<h2 align='left'>Goals of this project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get more comfortable with Figma (I'll make a wireframe for the project first).</li>
  <li>Get better at writing SCSS/CSS.</li>
  <li>Get even more experience with PHP and file managament.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This is a project that I made as an exercise for web development, it doesn't have any connections to real YouTube and the application works locally.</p>
